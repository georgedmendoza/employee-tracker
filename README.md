# employee-tracker

 ## Description 
  This application manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The user is able to select and action based on the options provided once the prompt starts. It will then display a table of information based on the user selection. Currently this application can only make edits to the role of an employee. For future development adding more editing options will give the user more flexibility to control the database
